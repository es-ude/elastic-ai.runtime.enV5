=== Encapsulated Libraries

We want to have the following goals

- fine-grained control over dependencies for flexibility and to facilitate link-time substitution
- prevent access to header files of transitive dependencies, i.e., if you call a function defined in `libB` you have to explicitly depend on it. There should not be a way to include a header provided by `B` without declaring that explicit dependency. This way, we avoid hidden source code dependencies. And each module only sees the header files it actually needs.
- for convenience, we want to have a target combines implementation and headers.

We achieve these by (typically) defining four build targets for each of our modules. Assuming we want to define a new library `A` that performs a direct call to library `B`. Then we define

`A__hdrs`:: providing access to all public header files of our module `A`, e.g.,
+
[source, cmake]
----
add_library(A__hdrs INTERFACE)
target_include_directories(A__hdrs INTERFACE include)
----
`A__impl`:: containing the implementation of `A`. This target needs access to the headers of its dependent modules, e.g.,
+
[source, cmake]
----
add_library(A__impl A.c)
target_link_libraries(A__impl PRIVATE B__hdrs)
----
+
`A`:: providing access to public headers for consuming targets (e.g., executables) and transitively providing dependent library implementations
[source, cmake]
----
add_library(A INTERFACE)
target_link_libraries(A INTERFACE A__impl A__hdrs)
----

Currently, the `elastic_ai_add_library` function provides most of this functionality. However, using it will prevent the IDE from automatically discovering your targets for the sake of jump-to-definition and auto-completion.

=== Building HW Dependent Libs
The build scripts will set a global variable `BUILDING_FOR_ELASTIC_NODE` to `true` iff we're building for an elastic node hardware.
If you need to define a HW dependent lib, e.g., because it calls into the pico_sdk, you should ask for that flag and define the `__impl` as an empty interface target. E.g.,

[source, cmake]
----
if(BUILDING_FOR_ELASTIC_NODE)
  add_library(A__impl A.c)
  target_link_libraries(A__impl PRIVATE Pico::pico_runtime__hdrs)
else()
  add_library(A__impl INTERFACE)
endif ()
----
