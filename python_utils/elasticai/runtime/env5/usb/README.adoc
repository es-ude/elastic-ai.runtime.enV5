= enV5 Remote Control Protocol

[.lead]
In this file the communication protocol is explained.

The communication is driven by the external device to determine the elasticNodes behavior.
The communication protocol is as follows. For each communication an ack or nack is sent by the receiver.
As a default we recommend to throw an error after 5 failed attempts.

The byteorder for number conversion is big endian.

This protocol only works with skeleton V2.

== Transmission
.Transmission
[cols="4*", options="header"]
|===
| 1 bytes | 4 bytes      | payload-size | Checksum-size
| command | payload-size | payload         | checksum
|===


== Checksum-function
1 byte XOR over all command + payload-size + payload bytes

== Commands
The first 128 are our commands.
The second 128 can be user specific commands.
