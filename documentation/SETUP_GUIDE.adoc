This guide aims to provide a detailed description on how to setup your development environment and contribute to this code base.

IMPORTANT: This Guide assumes you are using a UNIX-like System and have `git` already installed!

[#_get_the_source_code]
== Get the Source Code

At first, you have to download the source code from GitHub.
This can be archived by running

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/es-ude/elastic-ai.runtime.enV5.git enV5 #<1>
cd enV5 #<2>
----

in your terminal.

<1> Download the Repository
<2> Move inside the repository

[#_system_requirements]
== System Requirements

To determine if all required tools are installed, it is recommended to run

[source,bash]
----
./test_setup.sh
----

in your terminal.
If you have missing dependencies, this script will show which are missing.

[#_dependencies]
=== Dependencies

https://gcc.gnu.org/[GCC]::
-> C Compiler +
Can be installed via your local package manager like dnf, apt or brew.

https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm[ARM-None-EABI GCC]::
-> C Cross Compiler for ARM +
Can be installed via your local package manager like dnf, apt or brew.
+
.Note For MacOS
Install the cross compiler via
+
[source, bash]
----
$ brew install --cask gcc-arm-embedded
----
+
The packages `arm-none-eabi-gcc` and `arm-none-eabi-binutils` are known to cause issues, e.g., missing header files.

https://cmake.org[CMake]::
-> Build System +
Can be installed via your local package manager like dnf, apt or brew.

https://ninja-build.org/[Ninja]::
-> Build Tool +
Can be installed via your local package manager like dnf, apt or brew.

https://www.python.org/[Python] [OPTIONAL]::
-> Python Interpreter +
Can be installed via your local package manager like dnf, apt or brew. +
Used for development Server and Pre-commit!

https://nodejs.org/en[Node.js] [OPTIONAL]::
-> Javascript Runtime +
Can be installed via your local package manager like dnf, apt or brew. +
Used for Commitlint hook of Pre-Commit!

[#_pre_commit_optional]
=== Pre-Commit [optional]

To ensure our guidelines, we recommend using https://commitlint.js.org/#/[Commitlint] in combination with https://pre-commit.com/[Pre-Commit].
To assure you don't corrupt your system we recommend installing the dependencies inside a https://python.land/virtual-environments/virtualenv#How_to_create_a_Python_venv[virtual environment].

.Installation
1. Install https://nodejs.org/en[Node.js]
2. Install Node.js packages from link:../package.json[package.json] with `npm ci`
1. Create and checkout a virtual Python environment
2. Install required packages from link:../requirements.txt[requirements.txt]
3. Run `pre-commit install` to register the provided git hooks

NOTE: Node.js is required for Commitlint!

[#_ide]
== IDE

We recommend using CLion as your IDE, because this is our standard IDE and all necessary configurations are distributed with this repository.

Start Clion and import the repository folder as a new project.
When CLion has opened the folder and all <<System Requirements,required tools>> are installed, the IDE will now initialize the build folder, which holds all cmake generated build files.

To build and execute the unit tests, it is recommended to run the 'Unit Tests` target with the 'UnitTests' profile!

To build targets for the enV5 platform, you have to change the profile to either 'Debug' or 'Release'.
Then you are able to build all targets from 'enV5 Targets' folder.
The `*.uf2` files to flash the pico can be found under the link:out[out] folder in the root of the project.

[#_flash_the_env5]
== Flash the enV5

. Press and hold `MCU BOOT` on the Elastic Node
. Press `MCU RST` on the Elastic Node
. Release `MCU BOOT`
. Copy the `*.uf2` File to the RPI-RP2 device
** Via the USB device through your file manager
** Via the command line by executing `sudo cp out/<file>.uf2 /dev/ttyACM0`

[#_get_debug_output_from_the_env5]
== Get Debug Output from the enV5

To receive output from the enV5 you have to connect the enV5 to your local machine.
This can be accomplished by connecting the USB-C port of the enV5 with a USB port of your local machine.

Once the enV5 is connected to your computer, you can read the debug output from the device with a serial port reader like screen, minicom or
https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html[putty].

We recommend using minicom as it is the most versatile of the aforementioned tools.
You can receive the output of the device by executing

[source,bash]
----
minicom \
-o \ #<1>
-w \ #<2>
-b 115200  \ #<3>
-D /dev/ttyACM0 #<4>
----

in your terminal.

<1> Disable modem initialisation
<2> Enable line wrap
<3> Set the baud rate to 115200
<4> Define the serial port to read


[TIP]
====
If you can't receive output from your device, it may be connected to another serial port.
You can get a list of all available connections by executing

[source,bash]
----
# for Linux
ls /dev/ttyACM*

# for macOS
ls /dev/tty.*
----
in your terminal.

If you still can't receive any output from the enV5 the problem is possibly caused by a bug in the source code.
If the serial output is not initialized properly (see integration tests), the enV5 is not able to send the output to your device!
