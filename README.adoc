toc::[]

This repository aims to provide the Elastic-AI implementation for the Elastic Node version 5 (enV5).
Mor about this project can be found at the https://www.uni-due.de/es/elastic_ai.php[project homepage].

== Setup

For compiling the project, the required tools are:

* gcc (local C compiler)
* arm-non-eabi-gcc (C compiler for RP2040)
* CMake (Build Script Generator)
* Ninja (Build Tool)

We recommended pre-commit to check that the commit messages align with the conventional commit message standard.

TIP: You can check if your local machine satisfies the required dependencies by executing `test_setup.sh` script in the project link:.[root
directory].

After pulling the repository, you are required to download all submodules (see <<Submodules>>).
This can be archived by executing

[source,bash]
----
git submodule update --init --recursive
----

After installing all dependencies, you are now able to build the software targets.
First, you need to generate the build scripts with cmake and then execute them

NOTE: If you use the CLion IDE as recommended, the build script generation is done by the IDE itself.

If you want to do this by yourself, please refer to <<CMake>>.

To run the FPGA related flash scripts, it is recommended to create a local virtual Python environment and install the tools from the
link:bitfile_scripts/requirements.txt[requirements.txt] file.

TIP: link:documentation/SETUP_GUIDE.adoc[Setup Guide]

IMPORTANT: You have to adjust the network/mqtt broker credentials as mentioned in link:src/network/README.adoc#_wifi_lib[network README]!


== CMake

There are three CMake Profiles provided with the CLion settings:
*Debug*, *Release*, and *UnitTests*.

Only the _UnitTests_ profile allows you to compile source code for your local machine and therefore run the unit tests.
The _Debug_ and _Release_ targets differ only in the amount of printed information when the software is executed on an enV5-device.

.Profiles
[source,bash]
----
# Unit-test profile
cmake -B build/unit-tests -G Ninja -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG -D UNIT_TEST:BOOL=ON -D DEBUG_MODE:BOOL=ON

# Debug profile
cmake -B build/debug -G Ninja -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG -D UNIT_TEST:BOOL=OFF -D DEBUG_MODE:BOOL=ON

# Release profile
cmake -B build/release -G Ninja -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D UNIT_TEST:BOOL=OFF -D DEBUG_MODE:BOOL=OFF
----

The flag `-G Ninja` tells CMake to use Ninja as the build tool.
If this flag is not passed, CMake will use the default build tool on your machine (mostly Makefiles).

=== Target: Local Machine

The local execution of the source code requires a different hal implementation, due to the fact that the hal implementation from the `src` folder is directly connected to the pico-sdk which forces the compiler to build for the RP2040 arm-based platform instead of your local machine.
The hal dummies for the local machine can be found under link:test/unit/dummies/[test/unit/dummies].

==== Unit Tests

The unit-tests can be build and executed by running:

[source,bash]
----
# build the unit-tests
cmake --build build/unit-tests -j 4 --clean-first

# execute the unit-tests
ctest --test-dir build/unit-tests/test/unit --output-on-failure
----

The built unit-tests can then be found under
link:build/unit-tests/test/unit[build/unit-tests/test/unit] as executables.

=== Target Pico

==== Build all Targets

The debug targets can be built by executing:

[source,bash]
----
cmake --build build/debug -j 4
----

The release targets can be built by executing:

[source,bash]
----
cmake --build build/release -j 4
----

The `*.uf2` files to flash the pico can than be found under the
link:out[out] folder.

==== Hardware Tests

The hardware tests can be build using

[source,bash]
----
cmake --build build/debug -j 4 --target <test_name>
----

replacing `<test_name>` with the name of the test.

The resulting `<test_name>.u2f` files to flash the pico can be found under the link:./out[out] folder.

==== Flashing the Elastic Node version 5 (enV5)

. Press and hold `MCU BOOT` on the Elastic Node
. Press `MCU RST` on the Elastic Node
. Release `MCU BOOT`
. Copy the `*.uf2` File to the RPI-RP2 device

==== CMD line output

If the pico is connected to the local machine the `printf()` statements inside the code will be redirected to the USB and are available as serial port output.
This output can be read via a serial port reader like screen, minicom or
https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html[putty].

The following example shows how to use minicom on a Unix-based system:

[source,bash]
----
minicom \
-b 115200  \ #<1>
-o \ #<2>
-D /dev/ttyACM0 #<3>
----

<1> `-b 115200` -> baud rate for connection
<2> `-o` -> disable modem initialisation
<3> `-D /dev/ttyACM0` -> serial port

[IMPORTANT]
====
The serial port differs depending on the host machine!
It can be found via `ls /dev/tty*` (Linux) or `ls /dev/tty.*` (macOS) from the terminal.
====

==== Debug Output

To enable enhanced Debug output, add the flag `-D DEBUG_OUTPUT:BOOL=ON`
to the <<_cmake,CMake Setup call>> (or add it in the CLion CMake options).
This enables the `PRINT_DEBUG(...)` macro from link:src/common/include/Common.h[Common.h] in all targets.

== Submodules

Following submodules are being used

* https://github.com/es-ude/elastic-ai.runtime.c[es-ude/elastic-ai.runtime.c]
* https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk[raspberrypi/pico-sdk]
* https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel[FreeTROS/FreeRTOS-Kernel]
* https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/CException[ThrowTheSwitch/CException]
* https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity[ThrowTheSwitch/Unity]

== Troubleshooting

* In case the command which fetches the submodules fails, try executing `git submodule update --init --recursive --force`.
This will most likely fix the problem.
** It is recommended to erase all submodules from your local machine with `git submodules deinit --all`
* To generate a clean CMake Build without deleting and reinitializing the build directory run `cmake --build <build_dir> --target clean`.
* If the device doesn't connect to the wifi or mqtt broker make sure that you set up the correct credentials! (link:src/network/config/NetworkConfig.c[NetworkConfig.c])
