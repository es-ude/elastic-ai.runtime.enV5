== Remarks

Write to Flash::
- Write can't be more than **one** page
- Write performs **wrap around** when it reaches the end of a page
- Before performing a writing operation erasing the according sector is required

Erase Flash::
- The Lowest unit of erasing is one sector

Wear Level::
When performing write/erase operations, it will wear down the flash.
This leads to malfunctioning blocks of the flash.
Distributing the write/erase operations over the flash decreases the occurrence of defect cells!
