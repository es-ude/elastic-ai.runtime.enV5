= Vivado (FPGA IDE)

== Starting Vivado

. Go to Vivado installation directory (`cd ...`)
. Run `source settings64.sh`
. Run `vivado`

== enV5 Flash

All necessary files are in `experiment`

Connect Debugger::
. Connect both USB cables (FPGA JTAG and USB-C enV5)
. Power on FPGA (type "P" in minicom)
. Open Vivado Hardwaremanager and connect Debugger
.. Open Vivado
.. Click "Open Hardwaremanager"
.. Click "Open Target" > "Autoconnect"
. Right-click on Device > "Add Configuration Memory Device"
. Search for "fl128" and select "s25fl128sxxxxxx1-spi-x1_x2_x4"

CAUTION: JTAG cable for FPGA required

.XVC-Pico
[NOTE]
====
Instead of a https://digilent.com/shop/jtag-hs2-programming-cable/[Digilent JTAG Debugger] you can also use a Raspberry Pico in combination with https://github.com/kholia/xvc-pico[XVC-Pico]

====

Write to Flash::
. Right-click the memory configuration Device >> "Program Memory Configuration Device"
. Select the `.bin` file to upload
. Click the "MCU RST" Button on the device to power on the MCU

Read from Flash::
. Right-click memory configuration Device >> "Readback from Memory Configuration Device"
. Choose "BIN" as file format
. When unticking the "Address" Box you can
** Apply an Offset to start the read back (hex encoded)
** Specify the number of bytes you want to read back (hex encoded)

[TIP]
====
To get the length of your file, use:

[source,bash]
----
du -b <yourFile.bin>
----

Convert the output into a hexdecimal number, so you can use it for the "Datacount" field
====

=== How To verify the read-out data

. Use the `xxd` program to convert `.bin` files into `.hex` files.
. Use the `diff` program to compare the `.hex` files with each other

NOTE: The `.bin` against which the read-out is compared must also be converted!

.enV5_top_reconfig.bin
[example]
====
. Flash via HTTP or USB
. Readback from device
** The file is about 0x2AD10 Bytes Large.
Put this number into the "Datacount" field
** Choose "BIN" file as output format
. Convert source `.bin` file and the  `readback.bin` file into hex files using `xxd`
. Compare them using `diff <source.bin> <readback.bin>`

There shouldn't be any diff shown.
If so, the writing is correct; otherwise there the write to file inside the flash is corrupted!

== TCL Commands

* TCL Commands can be used to write a script that automates e.g. the readback process.
These TCL Commands can be found in the TCL Console in Vivado, after reading back a file.
